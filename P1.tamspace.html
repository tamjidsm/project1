		<h2>describe who you are and what you do.</h2>
<p>Hi! This is Sm Tamjid. I go by Tam. I live in Shrewsbury, MA with my family. Father of two. Boy 6 years and girl 6 month. 
By profession, I am a business system analyst. I work in financial services industry.</p>
		
		<h2>Why are you taking this course?</h2>
<p>I have interest in web development and new ideas on web. I can so far play with html, css, and with some content management system. I think the
knowledge on web programming is vital. After all facebook was first developed in php. I would like to know more on web programming.
I think this is a good start.</p>
		
		<h2>What previous experience do you have with programming?</h2>
<p>I have very little experience on programming. I have worked on basis java. I have conceptual knowledge on OO design. Beside, I know well SQL scripting</p>
		
		<h2>Are you working on a Mac, PC, or some other platform?</h2>
<p>I am working in PC.</p>
		
		<h2>Anything else we should know?</h2>
<p>This semester I am taking user experience design course in harvard extension. I think during my later project I would be able to apply
some of the UX knowledge that I would gain. Thanks.</p>
